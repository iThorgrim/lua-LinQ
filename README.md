# Linq Library ðŸ“Š

`Linq` is a powerful Lua library inspired by .NET's LINQ, providing an expressive and easy-to-use API for manipulating and querying data collections. It supports complex operations on multi-dimensional tables, making data handling in Lua both simple and efficient.

## Features

- **Filtering**: Select elements based on predicates.
- **Projection**: Transform each element of a collection into a new form.
- **Sorting**: Sort elements by a specified key.
- **Multi-dimensional Collections**: Easily manipulate multi-dimensional tables.
- **Aggregation**: Compute aggregate values like sum, average, max, and min.
- **Grouping**: Group elements by a specified key.
- **Distinct**: Get unique elements based on a key.
- **Zipping**: Combine two collections into one.
- **Appending**: Add elements from one collection to another.
- **String Conversion**: Represent tables as strings for easy inspection.

The Linq library offers a comprehensive [set of methods](https://github.com/iThorgrim/lua-LinQ/wiki/Method-Reference) for working with tables in Lua/Moonscript, making it easier to perform complex data manipulations efficiently and concisely.
